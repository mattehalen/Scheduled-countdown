## Bug Fixes
### 2020-11-15
- [X] Save on /Mathias dosen't save to correct
### Earlier fixes
- [X] OffsetTime .json writes empty files sometimes. - tried using sleep didn't work. - now trying increase setTimeoutTime = 150 instead of 50.
- [x] deleteButton on Scheduled don't work more then once. after deleting one it loops thrue and ads old cues again. Move Delete part to socket and don't jump back to adminScript.js?
